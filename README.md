# Forest For Life

### Introduction
Forest For Life is an informative website consisting of articles, blogs, and a game, all revolving around climate
change with an emphasis on deforestation.

The game premise is as such:

- A factory has recently been built near the user; it is producing pollution, effecting the user’s quality of air. 
The pollution levels are slowly rising, creating an ever-worsening environment. It is the user’s task to plant trees to
counteract the effects of pollution, turning pollution into clean air. The users core mission is to eventually plant 
enough trees to offset the effects of pollution and lower the pollution levels to eventually zero.
